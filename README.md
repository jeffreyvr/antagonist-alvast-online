# Antagonist Alvast Online

Fixing Alvast online from Antagonist for WordPress.

The Gutenberg/Block Editor from WordPress does not work correctly with Alvast Online (from Antagonist). This plugin tries to solve this problem by doing some additional finding and replacing of URLs.

This is not an official Antagonist plugin.
